## *Adventure in Python*
**A textbook that reads like a story.
A story that teaches you to code.**

---

You’re a beginner programmer
trapped in a mysterious digital world.
Your only way to survive? **Write code.**

This isn’t just another Python course.
It’s a **journey** — where you grow with the hero,
learning not in a straight line,
but through **action, discovery, and return.**

Each chapter is:

- A piece of the story
- A hands-on coding mission
- A new Python skill unlocked

**Learn Python. Live the story. Create your path.**
