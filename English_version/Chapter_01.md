## **📖 Chapter 1: Hello, World**  
*from Adventure in Python by Sergey Samoylov*

He awoke to the sound of silence—except, not silence.

It was the soft hum of electricity, the kind you don’t hear with ears but with the back of your teeth. 

His eyes opened, but nothing made sense. No walls. No ceiling. Only blackness… and a single line of white:

```
>>>
```

It blinked.  
Once.  
Again.  

A prompt. A memory surfaced. _Python_. Not a snake. A language.

He didn't know who he was, but his fingers moved like they remembered.

He typed:

```python
print("Hello, World")
```

And the void answered:

```
Hello, World
```

A moment of relief washed over him like warm light. He wasn't alone. He was... somewhere. Somewhere that responded.

Then the prompt returned.  
Still blinking.  
Waiting.  

> You have no identity.  
> No history.  
> But you can shape this place with code.  
> Survive.

He took a breath—instinct, habit. Here, breath was just a metaphor.

“I can work with this,” he whispered.

And the system, ever-watching, recorded its first log:

```
User initiated.
Level: Novice
Module: 1 - Basic I/O
```

> **Goal**: Learn to communicate with the world through Python’s basic tools.

### 🔹 `print()` — Your Voice in the Void

The `print()` function lets you speak to the system. It shows information on the screen.

```python
print("Hello, World")
print("My name is unknown.")
print("But I will learn.")
```

### 🔹 Variables — Naming the Nameless

A variable stores data. Think of it as a digital memory crystal.

```python
name: str = "Hero"
level: int = 1
is_awake: bool = True

print(name)
print("Level:", level)
```

### 🔹 Data Types

You’ll often work with different types of values:

| Type      | Example             |
|-----------|---------------------|
| String    | `"Code"`            |
| Integer   | `42`                |
| Float     | `3.14`              |
| Boolean   | `True`, `False`     |

You can check types using `type()`:

```python
print(type(name))      # <class 'str'>
print(type(level))     # <class 'int'>
```

### 🔹 Your First Mission

**Exercise: Write a short script that introduces yourself to the system.**

```python
# Replace values below
name: str = "Neo"
level: int = 1
language: str = "Python"

print("Initializing...")
print(f"Name: {name}")
print(f"Skill level: {level}")
print(f"Language of survival: {language}")
```

### 🧠 Challenge

Try changing the values of your variables and re-running the script.  
What happens if you leave quotes out around words?  
What if you use a number in a variable name?  
Try breaking things. The system will teach you through errors.
