The Companion tilted its head.

The Terminal flashed a word onto the screen:

```python
isinstance()
```

### 🕵️ What is `isinstance()`?

`isinstance()` checks if a value is an instance of a certain type.

It’s like asking Python:

> “Is this really a list? A string? An integer?”

---

### 🔍 Basic Usage

```python
value: str = "hello"

if isinstance(value, str):
    print("Yes, this is a string.")
```

✅ Returns `True` if `value` is of that type.

---

### 🧱 Why is it useful?

In complex programs, we sometimes work with many kinds of data.

We want our code to **react differently**  
depending on what type it's given.

---

### 📦 You can check against multiple types:

```python
data: list[int] = [1, 2, 3]

if isinstance(data, (list, tuple)):
    print("Sequence detected.")
```

Use a tuple of types to test against several at once.

---

### ⚠️ But don’t overuse it

Sometimes it’s better to just try something and handle errors (see `try` blocks!).

Still, `isinstance()` is perfect for:

- Validating input
- Designing flexible code
- Ensuring safe operations

### 🎯 Challenge: Type-Aware Program

Write a function that:

1. Takes any argument  
2. Prints:
   - If it’s a string → its length
   - If it’s a number → its square
   - If it’s a list or tuple → the reversed version
   - Otherwise: print `"Unknown type"`

Use `isinstance()` to handle this logic.

The Terminal buzzed, satisfied.

> “Understanding the type is the first step  
> to controlling behavior.”

The journey continues...
