Yes, we **have** used `input()` before. It showed up subtly back in:

- **Chapter 2**, when the hero first typed into the terminal.
- And again briefly in **Chapter 4**, when commands were entered.

But back then it was **minimal**, used more as a tool to simulate interaction.

### ðŸ“Œ So what's different now in Chapter 13?

This chapter finally:
- **Focuses** entirely on `input()` as a *concept*,
- Shows how to **branch** logic based on user responses,
- Teaches personalization (via `f-strings`, `.title()`),
- Presents **input as dialogue** â€” thematically and structurally.

### Think of it like this:

Earlier chapters:  
> "`input()` is just a keyboard."

Chapter 13:  
> "`input()` is *a voice*. It's a choice. It's an identity. It's an agency."

We're now giving it proper attention â€” as a **core mechanic** in interactive programming.
