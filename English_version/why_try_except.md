Great observation â€” and yes, it might **feel** like weâ€™re repeating.

Let's break that down a little.

### âœ… Why this chapter *seems* repetitive:

- We've already **encountered exceptions** in earlier chapters (like input parsing).
- We've used `try/except` blocks before in a **practical context**.

### ðŸ§  But hereâ€™s the difference:

**This chapter is the first time we pause and shine a spotlight** on:

- What **exceptions really are** (conceptually and structurally).
- That there are *many kinds* of exceptions.
- Why **blindly catching everything** is dangerous.
- That Python has a built-in **error hierarchy**.

Basically:  
Earlier, the hero *used a fire extinguisher*.  
Now heâ€™s learning what fire is â€” and when to use which extinguisher.

Now, [go back](Chapter_19.md) and enjoy the safety of this construction.
