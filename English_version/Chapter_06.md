## ðŸ“– Chapter 6: Decisions and Branching  
*from Adventure in Python by Sergey Samoylov*

The system remembered.  
The scripts ran.  
The bots obeyed.  
The virus slept.

But something was wrong.  
Everything was the same.

Every launch â€” identical lines.  
Every outcome â€” predictable.

He realized:  
The world **reacts**.  
His code should too.

He must **make choices**.

### ðŸ”¹ if / elif / else

```python
def analyze_temperature(temperature: int) -> None:
    """
    Analyze the temperature and react accordingly.
    """
    if temperature > 30:
        print(f"{temperature}Â°C â€” Too hot!")
    elif temperature > 10:
        print(f"{temperature}Â°C â€” Comfortable.")
    else:
        print(f"{temperature}Â°C â€” Cold.")


analyze_temperature(25)
```

### ðŸ”¹ Nested conditions

```python
def system_check(cpu_temp: int, disk_full: bool) -> None:
    """
    Check the systemâ€™s health and report status.
    """
    if cpu_temp > 70:
        print("âš  CPU Overheating!")
        if disk_full:
            print("ðŸ’¾ Disk is full as well.")
    else:
        print("âœ… System is stable.")


system_check(75, True)
```

### ðŸ”¹ Decisions from input

```python
def choose_path() -> None:
    """
    Prompt the user to choose a direction.
    """
    print("You stand at a digital crossroads.")
    direction: str = input("Where to? (left/right): ")

    if direction == "left":
        print("You enter the log archive.")
    elif direction == "right":
        print("You move toward the memory core.")
    else:
        print("Unknown path. You remain in place.")


choose_path()
```

## ðŸ§  Mission: Digital Hallways

Create a game called "Digital Hallway":
- The user chooses: forward / back / left / right.
- Each choice produces a unique result.
- After 3 moves, the game ends.

Use:
- `if/elif/else` for decisions
- `input()` for choices
- loops and counters to limit turns

> Conditionals give your code **a mind**.  
> Now your logic doesnâ€™t just **run** â€”  
> it **decides**.

and build your first **interactive quest**.
