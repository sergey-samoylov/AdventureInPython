Thanks for the question!

That's one of the deeper lines in the chapter, and itâ€™s meant to bridge coding logic with life philosophy. Letâ€™s unpack it:

---

### ðŸ’¡ "Itâ€™s what a value means when tested under pressure."

In **Python**, a value may seem simple at first glance:  
a string, a number, a list. But when it's **evaluated in a condition** â€”  
an `if`, a `while`, a logical expression â€” we find out something deeper:  
Is this value **truthy** or **falsy**?

That is:  
Its **real meaning is revealed not when itâ€™s idle**,  
but when itâ€™s **tested** in code.

---

This mirrors **life**.

People may appear strong, kind, wise...  
But their **true nature shows up** only in moments of stress,  
in times of pressure or urgency.

So just like in Python:

```python
if value:
    # only here do we see its truthiness
```

In life:

> You understand someoneâ€™s real values  
> when they face challenges.

---

In other words, this line says:

> A value might exist, but only testing reveals its true *role* or *truth*.

Both in code.  
And in character.
