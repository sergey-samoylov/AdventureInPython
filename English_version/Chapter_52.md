Time to reflect and connect everything learned so far,
just before stepping into the realm of **classes and objects**.

### 🧭 Chapter 52: The Map of Concepts — Preparing for the Object-Oriented World

The Hero had crossed many digital lands.

He’d battled bugs, decoded cryptic errors, and manipulated lists, dictionaries,
and files like a true wizard of the shell.

But something loomed on the horizon — something **bigger** than just variables
and functions.

A **structure**. A **system**. A world made of **objects**.

Before stepping into that world, he took a moment to rest and revisit what he’d mastered.

### 📜 Review of Core Concepts

Let’s tie the threads of this journey together:

#### ✅ Variables
Hold values. Nothing fancy — just names pointing to things.

```python
name = "Hero"
level = 3
```

#### ✅ Data Types
- `str`, `int`, `float`, `bool`
- `list`, `dict`, `tuple`, `set`

And how they behave — especially:
- Mutable (`list`, `dict`) vs.
- Immutable (`str`, `int`, `tuple`)

#### ✅ Control Flow
- `if`, `elif`, `else`
- `while`, `for`
- `break`, `continue`, `pass`

#### ✅ Functions
Your own spells. Reusable. Flexible.

```python
def heal(amount: int) -> str:
    return f"You healed {amount} HP!"
```

We even ventured into:
- **default arguments**
- **keyword arguments**
- **lambda functions**
- **decorators**
- **closures**

#### ✅ Modules and Imports
Breaking code into scrolls (modules).  
Using ancient libraries (`random`, `pathlib`, etc.).

#### ✅ Files and Paths
Reading and writing. Knowing where to find and place your data.

### 🧠 New Perspective: How All This Fits Together

> “Everything is an object” — whispered the wind of the System.

Even `int`, `str`, `list`… they're objects of certain **types**.  
And types? They're like blueprints — like **classes**.

You’ve been using objects all along.  
Now it’s time to **create your own**.

### 🎯 Challenge for You

Write a Python script that does the following:

1. Reads a file named `"hero_profile.txt"` containing:
   ```
   name: Luna
   level: 7
   health: 85
   ```

2. Parses this into a `dict`.

3. Uses a function `describe_hero(profile: dict) -> str`  
   to output a nice description like:
   ```
   Hero Luna is at level 7 with 85 health.
   ```

4. Bonus: Save this description to a new file using `pathlib`.

In the distance, a door appeared.  
It glowed faintly, etched with strange markings: `class`.

"Here we go," the Hero whispered.  
"Into the world of objects..."
