### 🧙 Chapter 54: The Magic of `self`

The programmer had seen symbols like `self` before,  
but only now did he truly begin to understand its power.

Within the class, `self` was everywhere.  
And outside the class… it vanished.  
Almost like a whisper spoken only to those who listened carefully.

---

### 🪄 What is `self`?

Inside every method of a class, the first parameter is **`self`**.

It’s not a keyword — you can technically name it anything.  
But by convention and clarity, we always use `self`.

When you write:

```python
class Wizard:
    def __init__(self, name: str):
        """Initialize a wizard with a name."""
        self.name = name

    def cast_spell(self) -> None:
        """Prints a spell-casting message."""
        print(f"{self.name} casts a spell!")
```

The `self` in `self.name` refers to the **current object**.

It connects the data (`name`) to the instance calling the method.

---

### 🧩 How it works

When you create a wizard:

```python
merlin = Wizard("Merlin")
```

You're creating an **instance** of the class.

When you call a method:

```python
merlin.cast_spell()
```

Python does something sneaky behind the scenes:

```python
Wizard.cast_spell(merlin)
```

Yes — it passes `merlin` as the **first argument** to `cast_spell`.  
That's why `self` must always be the first parameter of instance methods.

---

### 🔍 Why it matters

Using `self` gives you access to:

- The object’s own data (`self.name`, `self.power`, etc.)
- Other methods within the class (`self.attack()`, `self.defend()`)

You can think of `self` as:

> “I am me. I know who I am. I carry my own data.”

Without `self`, methods wouldn’t know which object they belong to.

---

### 🧠 Common Mistake

Forgetting `self`:

```python
class Bad:
    def oops():  # Missing self!
        """Incorrect method without self."""
        print("Oops!")
```

Python will raise a `TypeError` when you try to call `oops()`  
because it expects the object to be passed in automatically.

---

### 🛡 Challenge for You

Create a class `Monster` with:

- An `__init__` method that takes `name: str` and `hp: int`
- A `roar()` method that prints:
  ```
  The monster Ghoul roars with 120 HP!
  ```

Use `self` properly and **add docstrings** to both methods!
