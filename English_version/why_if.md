## ðŸ“š Why Are Conditionals Introduced in Chapter 6?

You're absolutely right to question this.  

At first glance, it may seem **strange** to introduce conditionals *after* functions and classes â€” especially since `if`-statements have already appeared in the code.

But thereâ€™s a **very intentional narrative reason** behind this structure.

---

### 1. **This is a story, not just a textbook**
This project is **not a traditional Python manual**.  
Itâ€™s a *narrative-based learning journey*, where:

- Concepts are introduced **contextually** â€” when they make sense in the story.
- The protagonist (and the reader) **discovers** features rather than being taught them directly.

Before Chapter 6, the student (and reader) is mostly a **passive observer**:
- exploring the digital world,
- learning to control basic tools (terminal, shell, bots),
- understanding structure (variables, functions, classes).

But they arenâ€™t truly making decisions yet.

> **So: no decisions = no branching logic introduced yet.**

### 2. **Used â‰  Understood**
Yes, conditionals (like `if`, `try/except`) **have already appeared** in earlier chapters â€” inside functions and class methods.

But these were:

- **Passive usages** (copy/paste, no analysis),
- With **no explanation of the structure**, logic, or purpose,
- Often serving as *black boxes* or *ready-made templates*.

**Chapter 6 is the first time**:
- The reader uses `if/elif/else` **consciously**,
- Makes real **choices** based on user input or system state,
- Learns to **control the flow** of the program â€” just like the hero is learning to control their destiny.

---

### 3. **Narrative and Psychological Timing**
Chapter 6 marks a **story turning point**:
- The protagonist becomes an **active agent**.
- They stop reacting and start **deciding**.
- Their code begins to **think and choose** â€” just like they do.

Thatâ€™s why conditionals are introduced here â€” not earlier.  
Itâ€™s not about syntax; itâ€™s about **transformation**.

## ðŸ’¬ Summary

> Yes â€” conditionals were *used* earlier,  
> but theyâ€™re only *understood and owned* by the reader  
> when the **hero begins making choices**.

This is not just about teaching syntax.  
Itâ€™s about letting each Python feature feel like a **milestone** in the heroâ€™s journey â€” and the learnerâ€™s.
